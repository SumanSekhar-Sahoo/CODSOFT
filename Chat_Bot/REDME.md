# 🤖 ChatBot – Rule-Based Terminal Bot by Suman

This is a colorful, terminal-based **rule-based chatbot** built using Python.  
It was developed as part of my **Codesoft Internship Task** and focuses on conversation logic using `if-else` and regex.

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot reads your input and checks for:
- Common greetings: `hi`, `hello`, `hey`
- Identity questions: `who are you`, `your name`
- Help: `help`, `options`
- Mood detection: `happy`, `sad`, etc.

It then responds in a formatted chat bubble using ANSI color codes.
